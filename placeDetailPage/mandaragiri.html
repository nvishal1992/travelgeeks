									<h3><b>Mandaragiri Hills</b></h3>
									<p><!-- Sakleshpur or Sakleshapura (Kannada: ಸಕಲೇಶಪುರ) is a hill station town and headquarters of Sakleshapura Taluk in Hassan district in the Indian state of Karnataka. The town lies in the Malnad region on the magnificent hills of the biodiversity hotspot, the Western Ghats. It has a temperate climate surrounded with lofty green hills full of coffee, cardamom, pepper and areca plantations. These crops which contribute mainly to the economy of the taluk are grown in the surrounding villages and the entire taluk are brought to Sakleshapura city for sale. The town lies on the National Highway 48 (NH-48) which connects the port city of Mangalore, with the capital city Bangalore of Karnataka state. The nearest airport is Mangalore International Airport.</p>
