									<h3><b>Sakleshpura</b></h3>
									<p>Sakleshpur or Sakleshapura (Kannada: ಸಕಲೇಶಪುರ) is a hill station town and headquarters of Sakleshapura Taluk in Hassan district in the Indian state of Karnataka. The town lies in the Malnad region on the magnificent hills of the biodiversity hotspot, the Western Ghats. It has a temperate climate surrounded with lofty green hills full of coffee, cardamom, pepper and areca plantations. These crops which contribute mainly to the economy of the taluk are grown in the surrounding villages and the entire taluk are brought to Sakleshapura city for sale. The town lies on the National Highway 48 (NH-48) which connects the port city of Mangalore, with the capital city Bangalore of Karnataka state. The nearest airport is Mangalore International Airport.</p>
									<p>The Manjarabad Fort was constructed by Pallada dore its a jail after Tippu Sultan accrued and invigorated this. It is located on the outskirts of Saklaeshapura on NH48. It has a star-shaped fort, with a hillock in the centre and eight corners. The climb to the hillock in the centre is difficult, but offers superb views. There is a hollow entrance in the centre, which is said to the entrance of a tunnel leading to Srirangapattana. There is a mural with the fort's map at the entrance which is in excellent condition. The fort is maintained by the Department of Archeology.</p>
